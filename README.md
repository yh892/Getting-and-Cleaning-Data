# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, Project1 Clearning Data.R, does the following:

Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory 
Load the activity, feature info, both the training and test datasets
Keeps only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets, right join code with activity names 
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in a text file.
